		<h1>Ini Adalah Cerita Pahit</h1>

		<p>Cholesterol is a fatty substance that is soft, yellow, produced by the body, mainly in the liver. Every day, the liver produces about 800 milligrams of cholesterol. Besides, cholesterol can also be derived from food such as animal products, seafood, milk and dairy products. Cholesterol at normal levels is useful for health, due to its essential fats that is needed for body cell formation. The decrease of cholesterol levels for western people plays an important role to the decline in death rates. Many large clinical trials showed that the increase of cholesterol levels was influenced by many factors, especially the habits of people in consuming food. However, it is also possible can be affected by other factors (Eriksson et al., 2016). Furthermore, many people are unaware of the dangers of cholesterol and the factors that can cause the increase of the cholesterol levels. Many genetic factors determine the cholesterol levels of people as well as environmental factors, especially their dietary habits (Mills et al., 2008). Current clinical CHD (coronary heart disease) treatment states that the individual vascular disease risk caused by cholesterol of each person should be examined to specify the precaution.

		<p>Meanwhile, the hospital of dr. Moewardi, a public hospital in Surakarta Indonesia, has been providing health services since 1912. One of their best services is the assessment of cholesterol levels which are classified into three classes of levels: high, normal and low level. These classes are influenced by four attributes which are gender, age, the history of smoking, and the history of diabetes. The cholesterol levels assessment is the most often service done by the laboratory in the hospital, even there are more than a hundred checkups per day. Thus, it has led thousands data accumulated stored and surprisingly useless in the database. Data mining is one of the best solutions offered to discover the knowledge over accumulated data to produce strategic information.

		<p>Data mining is a discipline to extract a large database to benefit organizations focus on the most significant facts from their hidden data in data warehouses (Deshpande & Thakare, 2010). By implementing this technique, the knowledge of cholesterol levels can be discovered from the large database owned by the hospital as well as finding the most significant variable causing the increase of cholesterol level. Thus, predicting the level of cholesterol of a patient is a great possibility depends on the attributes given. Compared with conventional method done by people, the data mining technique delivers the information efficiently and accurately.

		<p>Based on the case, the study aims to deliver the strategic information of cholesterol levels from a large database in the hospital of dr. Moewardi using three different criteria in decision tree induction to split the objects in data based on the attributes. In addition, we compared these three methods to know which is better based on their accuracy, recall, precision and root mean square error (RMSE).
